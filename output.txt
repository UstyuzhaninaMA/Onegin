And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
'My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!'
