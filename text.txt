'My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!'
